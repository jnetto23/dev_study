# Welcome

Hello, my name is **Jo√£o Netto**.  
In _2015_, I fell in love with technology and since then I study as a hobby in my free time.  
I am currently studying to become a good developer and have a career doing what I like. :blush:

I created this repository to store the exercises performed in courses and some personal tests.  
:computer::pencil2::books:

Feel free to review the codes and learn from them.
